How to make a good academic poster

## Designing a Poster
Please follow the resources in directory 'Stanford med poster guidelines'. They are downloaded from [https://med.stanford.edu/peds/scholarly-concentrations/research-resources.html](https://med.stanford.edu/peds/scholarly-concentrations/research-resources.html).

## Printing the Poster
Print 30 A4 hard copies of the poster along with the A0 hard copy.

## Pasting the Poster
* Even though the organizers promise to provide pasting materials, buy a double sided foam tape.
* Place the poster face (printed side) down on the floor. For each side of the poster, paste a piece of tap covering the whole side, not just the corners.
* Once all sides are fully convered by tapes, lift the poster and paste it on the board. Pasting tapes only to the corners of the poster may not allow the poster to be up for more than a day.

## Presenting the Poster
Fold few A4 hard copies so that they can fit into your palm. It makes them easier to hand over to the interested audiences.
